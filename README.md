This project is a passion project for any plugins or website based applications I need. The primary purpose was for an anonymous file uploader just so if I need to move one file from one to another computer, I can use this website to quickly upload and download.

The website itself contains a couple features, including login system, personal storage location, and shared storage spaces for signed in users.
The project itself can be pulled and installed by placing the files into XAMPP, however as of right now, all database setup and file directories are all hard coded. Soon, I will finish the setup script to make it easier to get the program installed.

As of right now, the future for the project entails fixing some vulnerabilities as well as possibly implementing more functions such as deleting.
